# Simplifying Image Compression with K-means Clustering
Introduction:
In today's digital age, images play a central role in our daily lives, from social media to websites and personal collections. However, storing and transmitting large image files can be resource intensive. Image compression helps overcome this challenge by reducing file size while preserving important visual information. In this blog post, we will explore one such technique called K-means clustering, which is commonly used for image stacking.

Understanding K-means Clustering:
K-means clustering is a popular algorithm used in unsupervised machine learning. It is mostly used for data clusters, where similar data points are grouped together. The algorithm works iteratively to find the focal points that represent the center of each cluster. These focal points are then used to provide data points to their neighboring units.
Image Compression with K-means:
Imagine a colorful picture with thousands of different colors. By using K-means clustering, we can reduce the number of colors in an image and preserve all its visual properties. This process involves selecting representative subsets of colors (centroids) and then replacing each pixel with the nearest point in the image.

Implementation Steps:

#Preprocess the image

original_img = plt.imread('bird_small.png')
X_img = np.reshape(original_img, (original_img.shape[0] * original_img.shape[1], 3))

#Select initial centroids

initial_centroids = kMeans_init_centroids(X_img, K)

#Run K-means algorithm

centroids, idx = run_kMeans(X_img, initial_centroids, max_iters)

#Assign pixels to centroids

idx = find_closest_centroids(X_img, centroids)

#Replace pixels with centroids

X_recovered = centroids[idx, :]

#Reconstruct the compressed image: Reshape the pixel assignments into the original image dimensions.

X_recovered = np.reshape(X_recovered, original_img.shape)

Benefits of Image Compression:Â 
Image compression offers many benefits, such as reduced file size, faster load time, better storage, and improved user experience With compression of images, we can significantly reducing the amount of storage space and bandwidth required for delivery. Smaller image files load faster across websites and digital platforms, giving users a smoother browsing experience. Additionally, compressed images consume less resources, making them ideal for large image backups or archives.

Conclusion:
In this blog post, we explored how to use K-means clustering to efficiently classify images. By reducing the number of colors in an image and preserving its visual fidelity, we can save significant amounts of money in storage space and bandwidth. Image embedding plays an important role in a variety of applications, from web development to digital photography, enhancing the user experience and optimizing product usage.
